            "1 clove of garlic",
            "2 teaspoons of mustard",
            "2 anchovies",
            "6 teaspoons of Worcestershire sauce",
            "Parsley, chopped",

            "5 teaspoons of lemon juice",
            "1/2 stick of butter"
        ],
        instructions: `
            Thinly slice the 3 scallions. Melt part of the butter in a skillet and sauté the scallions until soft and lightly golden. Remove from heat and allow to cool.

            In a blender, combine the garlic clove, anchovies, parsley, mustard, Worcestershire sauce, lemon zest, lemon juice, and the remaining fresh butter. Add the sautéed scallions and blend everything together until smooth.

            Blend until the mixture reaches a creamy, homogenous consistency. Add a pinch of salt to taste. Refrigerate before serving.

    {
    title: "Filetto al Pepe Verde",
    ingredients: [
        "800 g whole beef tenderloin",
        "30 g green peppercorns in brine",
        "100 g fresh liquid cream",
        "50 g Dijon mustard",

{
    title: "Poulet Crémeux à la Dijon",
    ingredients: [
        "150 g roasted potatoes (oven or air fryer)",
        "175 g chicken breast or thigh, raw",
        "1/2 onion, chopped",
        "2 garlic cloves, minced",
        "2 shallots (optional)",
        "1 teaspoon olive oil",
        "Bay leaf, to taste",
        "2 teaspoons onion powder",

    instructions: `
        Roast the potatoes in the oven or air fryer at 200°C (390°F) for 20 minutes.

        In a skillet or pot over high heat, add olive oil, chicken, and halved shallots (if using). Season with salt, black pepper, paprika, onion powder, Italian seasoning, and a bay leaf. Grill the chicken until fully cooked, approximately 10-12 minutes. Remove and set aside.

        Lower the heat to medium, and in the same skillet, add minced garlic, chopped onion, paprika, Italian seasoning, and Dijon mustard. Sauté until the onion becomes translucent and fragrant, about 2-3 minutes.

        Pour in the vegetable or chicken broth, light cream, and milk. Mix well to combine all the ingredients. Let the sauce simmer for 5 minutes, allowing the flavors to blend and the sauce to thicken slightly.

        Remove the skillet from the heat and return the chicken and shallots to the sauce. Garnish with fresh parsley leaves.

        Serve the creamy Dijon chicken with the roasted potatoes. Enjoy your meal!

            {
                 title: "Pasta",
                ingredients: [
                "300 g of flour",
                "100 g of water + 1 egg (or 150 g of water if not using an egg)",
                "A pinch of salt",
                ],
                instructions: `
                In a large bowl, combine the flour and a pinch of salt.
            If using an egg, lightly beat it and mix it with 100 g of water. If you prefer egg-free pasta, use an additional 50 g of water.
            Create a well in the center of the flour and pour in the water (and the egg, if used). Start incorporating the flour into the liquids, mixing until a dough forms.
            Transfer the dough onto a lightly floured surface and knead for about 10 minutes until it becomes smooth and elastic. If the dough is too sticky, add a little more flour; if it’s too dry, add a small amount of water.
            Wrap the dough in plastic wrap (cling film) and let it rest in the refrigerator for 20 minutes. This resting time allows the gluten to relax, making the dough easier to roll out.
            After resting, divide the dough into smaller portions. Using a pasta machine, begin rolling out the dough at the widest setting, gradually decreasing the thickness until you reach setting number 4.
            Your pasta is now ready to be used in your favorite recipe. Cut it into your desired shape or use it as sheets for lasagna.

            },
            {
    title: "Gnocchi",
    ingredients: [
        "4 large potatoes (about 800 g)",
        "All-purpose flour (as needed, about 200–300 g)",
        "Salt, to taste"
    ],
    instructions: `
        Place the potatoes in a large pot of salted water. Bring to a boil and cook until tender, about 20–25 minutes. A fork should easily pierce through them.

        Once cooked, drain the potatoes and let them cool slightly. Peel the potatoes and mash them thoroughly until you achieve a smooth consistency.

        Gradually add the flour to the mashed potatoes along with a pinch of salt. Mix until the dough is no longer sticky but still soft and workable. Avoid overworking the dough.

        Divide the dough into smaller portions. Roll each portion into a long, thin rope about 2 centimeters in diameter. Cut each rope into small pieces, about 2 centimeters long.

        Gently press each piece onto the tines of a fork, rolling it slightly to create ridges. This texture helps the sauce adhere better to the gnocchi.

        Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Cook the gnocchi in small batches until they float to the surface, about 2–3 minutes.

        Remove the gnocchi with a slotted spoon and serve immediately with your preferred sauce.

        title: "Pizza",
        ingredients: [
            "250 ml lukewarm water",
            "400 g all-purpose flour",
            "2 tablespoons olive oil",
            "3 teaspoons salt",
            "1 teaspoon granulated sugar",
            "1 tablespoon dry yeast or 1/4 block of fresh yeast"
        ],
        instructions: `
            In a bowl, dissolve the yeast (dry or fresh) in the lukewarm water with the sugar. Let it rest for a few minutes until the yeast begins to foam.

            Gradually add the flour to the bowl, mixing by hand as you go. Continue adding and mixing until a dough forms.

            Add the salt and olive oil to the dough and continue mixing by hand until all ingredients are fully incorporated.

            Transfer the dough to a lightly floured surface and knead by hand for about 10 minutes, using the palms of your hands to push the dough forward, then folding it back and turning slightly each time, until it becomes smooth and elastic.

            Place the dough in a bowl lightly greased with olive oil, cover it with plastic wrap, and let it rise in a warm place for about 1–2 hours, or until it doubles in size.

            Once the dough has risen, gently deflate it with your hands and transfer it to a lightly floured surface.

            Roll out the dough with your hands to achieve the desired shape and thickness.

            Add your preferred toppings to the surface of the dough.

            Bake in a preheated oven at 170°C (340°F) for 20–25 minutes, or until the pizza is golden and crispy.

    {
        title: "Pane (Bread)",
        ingredients: [
            "800 g flour",
            "450 g water",
            "Brewer's yeast (as needed)",
            "2 tablespoons olive oil",
            "1 heaping tablespoon salt",
            "1 teaspoon honey"
        ],
        instructions: `
            In a large bowl, pour the flour and create a well in the center.

            Dissolve the brewer's yeast in a small amount of lukewarm water and pour it into the well.

            Add the remaining water, olive oil, salt, and honey. Begin mixing until the dough is smooth and homogeneous.

            Let the dough rest for 20 minutes, covered with a cloth.

            (For quick bread) After 20 minutes, divide the dough into loaves of the desired size. Cover the loaves and let them rise in a warm place for 2–4 hours until they double in size. Proceed to bake.

            (For slow fermentation bread) Prepare the dough as above, then refrigerate it for 12–18 hours to allow it to mature. After maturation, shape the dough into loaves and let them rise for 3–4 hours at room temperature. Proceed to bake.

            Before baking, make shallow cuts across the top of each loaf to ensure even cooking.

            Bake in a preheated static oven at 250°C (480°F) until fully cooked and golden brown.

        title: "Piadina",
        ingredients: [
            "500 g flour",
            "250 ml water (or 150 ml water + 100 ml milk)",
            "50 g margarine or butter",
            "1 tablespoon olive oil",
            "1 tablespoon salt",
            "10 g baking powder"
        ],
        instructions: `
            In a large bowl, sift together the flour and baking powder. Add the salt and mix well.

            Melt the margarine (or butter) and add it to the flour mixture along with the olive oil.

            If using both water and milk, mix them together, then gradually add the liquid to the flour mixture, kneading until a smooth and homogeneous dough forms.

            Cover the dough with a cloth and let it rest at room temperature for 30 minutes.

            After resting, divide the dough into 6 equal portions and shape them into balls. Cover the balls and let them rest for another 30 minutes.

            Roll out each ball on a lightly floured surface with a rolling pin into a thin disk, about 2-3 mm thick.

            Heat a non-stick skillet over medium-high heat. Cook each piadina in the hot skillet for about 2-3 minutes on each side, or until golden spots appear on the surface. Flip the piadina once during cooking.

    instructions: `
        In a small saucepan, melt the palm sugar over medium heat, stirring until it turns slightly darker. Add water, fish sauce, and tamarind, stirring continuously. The caramel may solidify initially but will fully dissolve while preparing other ingredients.

        Cut soaked noodles once with scissors to handle more easily. In a bowl, combine tofu, garlic, shallots, sweet daikon, dried shrimp, and chili flakes.

        Heat a wok or large non-stick skillet over high heat, add a drizzle of oil. Cook shrimp until fully cooked, remove from pan, and set aside.

        In the same pan, add more oil if needed, then add the tofu-garlic mixture. Sauté until garlic turns golden and shallots soften.

        Add soaked noodles and prepared Pad Thai sauce, stirring until noodles fully absorb the liquid. If noodles seem dry, add water one tablespoon at a time.

        Push noodles to one side of the pan, drizzle some oil on the empty side, and crack in eggs. Break yolks and cook for about 30 seconds. Cover eggs with noodles, let cook for another 30 seconds, then stir thoroughly to combine.

        Serve immediately with a lime wedge and sprinkle remaining peanuts on top. For an authentic finish, add extra chili flakes, fresh bean sprouts, and Thai chives as desired.
