    ingredients: [
        "150 g roasted potatoes (oven or air fryer)",
        "175 g chicken breast or thigh, raw",
        "1/2 onion, chopped",
        "2 garlic cloves, minced",

                 title: "Pasta",
                ingredients: [
                "300 g of flour",
                "100 g of water + 1 egg (or 150 g of water if not using an egg)",
                "A pinch of salt",
                ],
                instructions: `
                In a large bowl, combine the flour and a pinch of salt.
            If using an egg, lightly beat it and mix it with 100 g of water. If you prefer egg-free pasta, use an additional 50 g of water.
            Create a well in the center of the flour and pour in the water (and the egg, if used). Start incorporating the flour into the liquids, mixing until a dough forms.
            Transfer the dough onto a lightly floured surface and knead for about 10 minutes until it becomes smooth and elastic. If the dough is too sticky, add a little more flour; if it’s too dry, add a small amount of water.
            Wrap the dough in plastic wrap (cling film) and let it rest in the refrigerator for 20 minutes. This resting time allows the gluten to relax, making the dough easier to roll out.
            After resting, divide the dough into smaller portions. Using a pasta machine, begin rolling out the dough at the widest setting, gradually decreasing the thickness until you reach setting number 4.
            Your pasta is now ready to be used in your favorite recipe. Cut it into your desired shape or use it as sheets for lasagna.

            },
            {
    title: "Gnocchi",
    ingredients: [
        "4 large potatoes (about 800 g)",
        "All-purpose flour (as needed, about 200–300 g)",
        "Salt, to taste"
    ],
    instructions: `
        Place the potatoes in a large pot of salted water. Bring to a boil and cook until tender, about 20–25 minutes. A fork should easily pierce through them.

        Once cooked, drain the potatoes and let them cool slightly. Peel the potatoes and mash them thoroughly until you achieve a smooth consistency.

        Gradually add the flour to the mashed potatoes along with a pinch of salt. Mix until the dough is no longer sticky but still soft and workable. Avoid overworking the dough.

        Divide the dough into smaller portions. Roll each portion into a long, thin rope about 2 centimeters in diameter. Cut each rope into small pieces, about 2 centimeters long.

        Gently press each piece onto the tines of a fork, rolling it slightly to create ridges. This texture helps the sauce adhere better to the gnocchi.

        Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Cook the gnocchi in small batches until they float to the surface, about 2–3 minutes.

        Remove the gnocchi with a slotted spoon and serve immediately with your preferred sauce.

        title: "Pizza",
        ingredients: [
            "250 ml lukewarm water",
            "400 g all-purpose flour",
            "2 tablespoons olive oil",
            "3 teaspoons salt",
            "1 teaspoon granulated sugar",
            "1 tablespoon dry yeast or 1/4 block of fresh yeast"
        ],
        instructions: `
            In a bowl, dissolve the yeast (dry or fresh) in the lukewarm water with the sugar. Let it rest for a few minutes until the yeast begins to foam.

            Gradually add the flour to the bowl, mixing by hand as you go. Continue adding and mixing until a dough forms.

            Add the salt and olive oil to the dough and continue mixing by hand until all ingredients are fully incorporated.

            Transfer the dough to a lightly floured surface and knead by hand for about 10 minutes, using the palms of your hands to push the dough forward, then folding it back and turning slightly each time, until it becomes smooth and elastic.

            Place the dough in a bowl lightly greased with olive oil, cover it with plastic wrap, and let it rise in a warm place for about 1–2 hours, or until it doubles in size.

            Once the dough has risen, gently deflate it with your hands and transfer it to a lightly floured surface.

            Roll out the dough with your hands to achieve the desired shape and thickness.

            Add your preferred toppings to the surface of the dough.

            Bake in a preheated oven at 170°C (340°F) for 20–25 minutes, or until the pizza is golden and crispy.

            "1 heaping tablespoon salt",
            "1 teaspoon honey"
        ],
        instructions: `
            In a large bowl, pour the flour and create a well in the center.

            Dissolve the brewer's yeast in a small amount of lukewarm water and pour it into the well.

            Add the remaining water, olive oil, salt, and honey. Begin mixing until the dough is smooth and homogeneous.

            Let the dough rest for 20 minutes, covered with a cloth.

            (For quick bread) After 20 minutes, divide the dough into loaves of the desired size. Cover the loaves and let them rise in a warm place for 2–4 hours until they double in size. Proceed to bake.

            (For slow fermentation bread) Prepare the dough as above, then refrigerate it for 12–18 hours to allow it to mature. After maturation, shape the dough into loaves and let them rise for 3–4 hours at room temperature. Proceed to bake.

            Before baking, make shallow cuts across the top of each loaf to ensure even cooking.

            Bake in a preheated static oven at 250°C (480°F) until fully cooked and golden brown.

            Melt the margarine (or butter) and add it to the flour mixture along with the olive oil.

            If using both water and milk, mix them together, then gradually add the liquid to the flour mixture, kneading until a smooth and homogeneous dough forms.

            Cover the dough with a cloth and let it rest at room temperature for 30 minutes.

            After resting, divide the dough into 6 equal portions and shape them into balls. Cover the balls and let them rest for another 30 minutes.

            Roll out each ball on a lightly floured surface with a rolling pin into a thin disk, about 2-3 mm thick.

            Heat a non-stick skillet over medium-high heat. Cook each piadina in the hot skillet for about 2-3 minutes on each side, or until golden spots appear on the surface. Flip the piadina once during cooking.

            "6 green onions",
            "4 garlic cloves",
            "5 cm piece of ginger",
            "6–12 dried chilies (optional)"
        ],
        instructions: `
            Prepare the marinade: In a bowl, whisk two egg whites until foamy. Add 3 tablespoons soy sauce, 3 tablespoons Chinese cooking wine, and 3 tablespoons vodka. Reserve 3 tablespoons of this mixture. To the remaining marinade, add 1/4 teaspoon baking soda and 3 tablespoons cornstarch, mixing until smooth. Cut 700 g of boneless chicken thighs into 3 cm cubes and marinate for 30 minutes.

            While the chicken marinates, prepare the sauce: In a separate bowl, mix 4 tablespoons soy sauce, 1 tablespoon rice vinegar, 4 tablespoons Chinese cooking wine, 4 tablespoons chicken broth, 1/4 cup sugar, 1 teaspoon toasted sesame oil, and 1 tablespoon cornstarch. Mix until smooth. Finely chop 6 green onions, 4 garlic cloves, and a 5 cm piece of ginger, setting them aside for later.

            Cook the vegetables and sauce: In a skillet over medium-high heat, toast the dried chilies (optional). Sauté the chopped green onions, garlic, and ginger in a little oil. Add the chilies when the vegetables are golden. Pour in the sauce mixture and cook until it thickens.

            For the coating: In a tray, mix 1 cup all-purpose flour, the remaining cornstarch, 1 teaspoon baking powder, and 1 teaspoon salt. Add the reserved marinade and mix until crumbly.

            Dredge each piece of marinated chicken in the coating mixture, ensuring it's fully covered. Heat oil in a large skillet for frying. Fry the coated chicken until golden and cooked through. Drain on a wire rack or paper towels.

            To serve, toss the fried chicken in the skillet with the prepared sauce. Gently stir to coat the chicken without breaking the crust. Garnish with some chopped green onions and serve with rice.

            "Vegetable oil for frying",
            "Fried garlic (for garnish)"
        ],
        instructions: `
            Cut the red onion, red bell pepper, and green bell pepper into 2.5 cm pieces and set aside.

            Season the chicken pieces with salt and let them rest, covered, at room temperature for about 8 minutes.

            In a bowl, mix the dry ingredients (flour, cornstarch, baking powder, and baking soda). Add the ice-cold water and mix well. Stir in 15 ml of vegetable oil to create a smooth batter.

            Heat vegetable oil in a deep pot to 175°C (347°F). Dip the chicken pieces into the batter and fry in batches for 2–4 minutes or until golden and crispy. Remove and place on paper towels to drain excess oil.

            In a wok or deep skillet, heat 30 ml of vegetable oil over medium-high heat. Add the red onion, red bell pepper, and green bell pepper. Stir-fry for 1–2 minutes until slightly softened but still crisp.

            Lower the heat to medium. Add the fried chicken to the wok along with the vegetables. In a small bowl, mix sugar, ketchup, Sriracha, rice vinegar, hot water, and minced ginger. Pour the sauce into the wok and bring it to a boil. Stir cornstarch with water to make a slurry, then add it to the sauce to thicken. Cook for 1–2 minutes, ensuring the chicken and vegetables are well coated.

            Add minced garlic just before serving for a fresh, aromatic touch. Serve hot over steamed rice, garnished with fried garlic if desired.
