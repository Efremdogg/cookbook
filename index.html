{ title: "Pasta", 
categories: ["Pasta","Dough"], 
ingredients: [
"300 g of flour",
"100 g of water + 1 egg (or 150 g of water if not using an egg)",
"A pinch of salt"
],
rating: 5,
caloriesPerServing: 517, 
instructions: `
In a large bowl, combine the flour and a pinch of salt.
If using an egg, lightly beat it and mix it with 100 g of water. If you prefer egg-free pasta, use an additional 50 g of water.
Create a well in the center of the flour and pour in the water (and the egg, if used). Start incorporating the flour into the liquids, mixing until a dough forms.
Transfer the dough onto a lightly floured surface and knead for about 10 minutes until it becomes smooth and elastic. If the dough is too sticky, add a little more flour; if it’s too dry, add a small amount of water.
Wrap the dough in plastic wrap (cling film) and let it rest in the refrigerator for 20 minutes. This resting time allows the gluten to relax, making the dough easier to roll out.
After resting, divide the dough into smaller portions. Using a pasta machine, begin rolling out the dough at the widest setting, gradually decreasing the thickness until you reach setting number 4.
Your pasta is now ready to be used in your favorite recipe. Cut it into your desired shape or use it as sheets for lasagna.

{ title: "Gnocchi",

ingredients: [
"4 large potatoes (about 800 g)",
"All-purpose flour (as needed, about 200–300 g)"
,"Salt, to taste"
],
rating: 4.7,
caloriesPerServing: 282,
instructions: `
Place the potatoes in a large pot of salted water. Bring to a boil and cook until tender, about 20–25 minutes. A fork should easily pierce through them.
Once cooked, drain the potatoes and let them cool slightly. Peel the potatoes and mash them thoroughly until you achieve a smooth consistency.
Gradually add the flour to the mashed potatoes along with a pinch of salt. Mix until the dough is no longer sticky but still soft and workable. Avoid overworking the dough.
Divide the dough into smaller portions. Roll each portion into a long, thin rope about 2 centimeters in diameter. Cut each rope into small pieces, about 2 centimeters long.
Gently press each piece onto the tines of a fork, rolling it slightly to create ridges. This texture helps the sauce adhere better to the gnocchi.
Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Cook the gnocchi in small batches until they float to the surface, about 2–3 minutes.
Remove the gnocchi with a slotted spoon and serve immediately with your preferred sauce.

rating: 4.6,
caloriesPerServing: 418,
instructions: `
In a bowl, dissolve the yeast (dry or fresh) in the lukewarm water with the sugar. Let it rest for a few minutes until the yeast begins to foam.
Gradually add the flour to the bowl, mixing by hand as you go. Continue adding and mixing until a dough forms.
Add the salt and olive oil to the dough and continue mixing by hand until all ingredients are fully incorporated.
Transfer the dough to a lightly floured surface and knead by hand for about 10 minutes, using the palms of your hands to push the dough forward, then folding it back and turning slightly each time, until it becomes smooth and elastic.
Place the dough in a bowl lightly greased with olive oil, cover it with plastic wrap, and let it rise in a warm place for about 1–2 hours, or until it doubles in size.
Once the dough has risen, gently deflate it with your hands and transfer it to a lightly floured surface.
Roll out the dough with your hands to achieve the desired shape and thickness.
Add your preferred toppings to the surface of the dough.
Bake in a preheated oven at 170°C (340°F) for 20–25 minutes, or until the pizza is golden and crispy.

instructions: `
   In a bowl, mix flour with crumbled yeast. Add water gradually, stirring until absorbed. When dough starts forming, transfer to a work surface.
   Knead energetically, stretching dough and folding it back, turning 90° each time. Once smoother, add olive oil in 3–4 batches, letting it absorb fully. Finally, add salt and knead until incorporated. Cover dough with a bowl and rest 15 minutes.
   Perform slap & fold folds: lift dough, slap it on the counter, and fold over itself 2–3 times. Rest covered for 15 minutes. Repeat at least twice, resting 15 minutes between each round.
   Place dough in an oiled bowl, cover with plastic wrap, and let rise at room temperature (26–28 °C) for about 3 hours until tripled in volume.
   Oil a 25×38 cm baking tray. Transfer dough and gently stretch toward edges with your fingers. If it resists, rest covered 5 minutes, then continue. Let rise covered for another 1 hour.
   Pour 60 g olive oil on top, dimple surface with fingertips, and sprinkle with Maldon salt.

  caloriesPerServing: 432,
  instructions: `
Make the red broth by dissolving the tomato paste in the hot water (or use passata + water). Salt it and bring to a light simmer, then keep warm.
In a very large, heavy pan (carbon steel or cast iron), sauté the oil, garlic, and chili. When the garlic is golden, add the ½ cup of undiluted passata and reduce for 1 minute.
Lay the raw spaghetti directly on the sauce and raise the heat to medium-high. Let it fry without touching for about 1 minute, until it starts to crisp and stick to the pan. Flip carefully so you don’t break it and brown the other side.
Cook the pasta risotto-style: add a couple of ladlefuls of hot broth at a time. Wait until it’s absorbed and the pasta starts to sizzle and catch on the bottom, then add more broth. Continue like this, stirring gently, until the package cook time (or a little beyond, if needed).
Adjust salt only at the end, if needed. The pasta should be al dente, with the characteristic crispy, slightly charred spots of Spaghetti all’Assassina.

   Finely chop mushrooms, shallots, and garlic. Heat olive oil over medium heat and sauté shallots and garlic until translucent. Add mushrooms, season with salt, and cook until liquid evaporates (5–8 minutes). Add whiskey and thyme, let reduce, then cool. This is the duxelles.
   Prepare the crêpe: whisk flour, milk, egg, and a pinch of salt into a smooth batter. Cook a thin crêpe in a lightly buttered non-stick pan for 1–2 minutes per side. Set aside.
   Pat beef dry with paper towels, season generously with salt and pepper. In a hot pan with smoking oil, sear beef for 1.5–2 minutes per side (including ends). Immediately brush with Dijon mustard while hot. Let cool to room temperature.
   Assemble: place crêpe on plastic wrap, layer prosciutto slices, spread mushroom duxelles, then place beef in the center. Roll tightly using the wrap, seal well, and chill 30–60 minutes.
   Roll puff pastry to 3 mm thick. Place wrapped beef in center, enclose fully, and seal edges. Optionally decorate with lattice from extra pastry. Brush entire surface with egg yolk–water mixture.
   Bake at 200 °C fan (or 220 °C static) for 35–40 minutes until pastry is golden. For medium-rare beef, internal temperature should reach 50–52 °C.
   Rest 10 minutes before slicing. Serve with sides of choice and, optionally, a sauce made by reducing chicken stock by 75% and whisking in cold butter.

Make the filling. Heat the oil in a heavy pot. Sear the mushrooms until browned; remove and set aside. In the same pot, brown the beef. Add onion, carrot, and garlic; cook until slightly softened. Stir in the mushrooms, tomato paste, mustard, Worcestershire, soy sauce, the herb sprigs, and bay leaf. Pour in the ale, bring to a boil, then reduce to a gentle simmer. Cover and cook until the beef is tender and the liquid has reduced. Discard the herbs, stir in the cornstarch slurry, and simmer a couple of minutes to thicken. Let the stew cool completely.
Make the pastry. Mix the flour and salt in a bowl. Rub in the cold butter until it looks like coarse crumbs. Drizzle in ice water just until the dough holds together. Divide into two discs, wrap, and chill at least 30 minutes.
Assemble. Roll one disc and line muffin tins for mini pies or a 23 cm pie dish for one large pie. Fill with the cooled stew. Roll the second disc and cover; seal the edges well and brush with egg wash. Cut a few vents on top.
Bake. For mini pies: 190°C for about 35–40 minutes. For one large pie: 200°C for 45–60 minutes. The crust should be deep golden and crisp.
Rest briefly before serving. Great with mashed potatoes and buttery peas for classic pub vibes.

   In a small saucepan, melt the palm sugar over medium heat, stirring until it turns slightly darker. Add water, fish sauce, and tamarind, stirring continuously. The caramel may solidify initially but will dissolve while you prep other ingredients.
   Soak rice noodles in room-temperature water for about 1 hour until flexible but not fully soft. (Shortcut: soak in hot water 3 minutes, then rinse in cold water.)
   Cut soaked noodles once with scissors. In a bowl, combine tofu, garlic, shallots, sweet daikon, dried shrimp, and chili flakes.
   Heat a wok over high heat with a drizzle of oil. Cook shrimp until done; remove and set aside.
   In the same pan, add more oil if needed, then add the tofu-garlic mixture. Sauté until garlic is golden and shallots soften.
   Add soaked noodles and the Pad Thai sauce; stir until noodles absorb the liquid. If dry, add water 1 tbsp at a time.
   Push noodles to one side, add a little oil, crack in eggs. Break yolks and cook ~30 seconds, cover with noodles, cook another 30 seconds, then mix through.
   Return shrimp, add bean sprouts, Thai chives, and half the peanuts. Toss quickly and turn off heat.
   Serve immediately with a lime wedge and the remaining peanuts. Add extra chili flakes, sprouts, and chives to taste.
